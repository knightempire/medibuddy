## **Live Demo**
Check out the live demo of the project: [Live Demo](https://medibuddy-ten.vercel.app/)

## **Overview**

This project is developed as part of a web page development assignment, where the goal is to translate a Figma design into a fully responsive webpage using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The web page fetches its content dynamically from an API and renders it based on the configuration provided.

### **Key Technologies Used:**
- **React** (with Next.js)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **API Integration** (fetching and rendering content dynamically)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Vercel** for hosting

### **Responsive Design Images:**

For small devices (mobile screens), use the following image:
